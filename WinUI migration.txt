Replace all Bindings
- Static references (simplified)
- With x:DataType
- Keeping Bindings with ElementName refering to the current Window for Command handlers and page-level members in templates

Replace records since it's not supported if the record is used in x:DataType (see https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/5315)

Namespace update (from System.... to Microsoft....)

Replace usings for namespaces imports in XAML files (to "using:MyNamespace" scheme even for external namespaces)

WinUI XamlControlResources addition in App.xaml

Issues
======
Fatal crash on ConccurentDictionary.TryAddInternal: ensure you're not updating a databound value (such as an ObservableProperty) from a different thread.
I had to move all Observable notifications to the caller instead of the corresponding source object (meaning it's not a notification anymore, as it's triggered externally from the UI thread).
I don't like this but it prevents having to call DispatcherQueue.TryEnqueue from a standalone thread (which might not even have access to DispatcherQueue).


Platforms
=========
WPF: remove static bindings as it doesn't seem to work. Use proxy local getters instead (public Type MyVar => MyStaticVar);
Linux : install WSL (obviously) and Ubuntu or any other distro. 
	Then add GTK (to avoid the "missing libc" error on launch) using :
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev mesa-utils libgl1-mesa-glx ttf-mscorefonts-installer

GTK: Install GTK from https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases as stated in https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started-wizard.html
